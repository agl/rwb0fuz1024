This is example code for a Rabin-Williams public-key signature scheme designed
to provide high speed verification and small signatures. Key points:

  1. Fast verification: about 7us for a short message on a 2.33GHz Core2 (1024
     bit key). RSA 1024 on the same hardware is about 4x slower.
  2. Small(er) signatures: signatures are half the size of RSA signatures for
     the same key strength.
  3. A hash generic attack is provably equivalent to factoring.
     This scheme is parameterised over the length of the public key which will
     be referred to as s in this text.

The code itself assumes s = 1024, although this is easy to change.

This is simply an exposition of the work of Rabin, Williams, Bernstein,
Bleichenbacher and others. Any artifice found here is theirs, any mistakes are
mine.
